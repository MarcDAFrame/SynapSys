## program that spreads computation across computers; Silver medal in Toonto wide science fair.

### SynapSys is a program that spreads computation among multiple computers

My partner, Matthew Philips and myself won a silver medal in the [Toronto Science Fair](http://www.torontosciencefair.ca/). This project was a great learning opportunity for me with working with GUI, Sockets and was my first introduction to Python.
